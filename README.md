# Books API testing from Postman ðŸ§ª

During my learning on January 2024 about REST-API I decided to create a repository. To be honest I have forgotten about this project :D

This API is simple and easy to understand. This is how hierarchy is presented:

![Postman Flow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7123848c-6630-4ec3-b810-683e7c2d0ed0)

On each endpoint I wrote some validations in JavaScript programming language. I initialized local and collection variables.  
Variable name BookId is dynamic. Every each send endpoint named add book will change BookId value.
